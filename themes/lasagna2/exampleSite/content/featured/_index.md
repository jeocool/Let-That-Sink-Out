This is featured posts index page. As you can see,
not only one post is presented here, but all posts which
are placed in the same folder as this `_index.md`.In this
case you don't have to set hidden flag to all these posts - 
just set it in the `_index.md` file and also set `featured:true`
so it will appear in the Featured posts section.
