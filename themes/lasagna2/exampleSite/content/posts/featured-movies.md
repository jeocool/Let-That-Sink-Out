## BAFTA Award for Best Film

The BAFTA Award for Best Film is given annually
by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and
presented at the British Academy Film Awards. It has been
given since the 1st BAFTA Awards, representing the best films
of 1947, but until 1969 it was called the BAFTA Award for Best Film From Any Source. It is possible for films from any 
ountry to be nominated, although British films are also recognised in the category BAFTA Award for Best British Film and (since 1983) foreign-language
films in BAFTA Award for
Best Film Not in the English Language. As such,
there have been multiple occasions of a film being nominated in two of these categories.

There has been one tie for the Best Film Award when,
in 1962, Ballad of a Soldier tied with The Hustler for
Best Film From Any Source. Throughout the history of the category, the award has been given to the director(s), the producer(s) or both.
