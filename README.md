# Let That Sink Out

step 0: sign into Twitter from a desktop browser that supports extensions (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc). make sure you're already following any "verified user" you want to see posts from (especially the ones with over a million followers)

step 1: install an extension that autoblocks any Twitter Blue users on sight like [BluesBlocker (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bluesblocker/dbcfmkldigmecjpjeojbcfbjidmcngfe) or [Blue Blocker (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blue-blocker/)

step 2: open any post that's gone viral with Twitter Blue, like [this post by Bette Midler](https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/1649218711348473856) or [this one from @TwitterBlue](https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1638988196380827651). keep revisiting the page occasionally, so the extension can keep loading more accounts to block

step 3: enjoy your newly-enhanced Twitter browsing experience across all devices
