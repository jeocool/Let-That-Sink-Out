step 0: sign into Twitter from a desktop browser that supports extensions (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc)

step 1: install any extension that autoblocks Twitter Blue users on sight:

- [BluesBlocker (Chrome)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bluesblocker/dbcfmkldigmecjpjeojbcfbjidmcngfe)
- [Blue Blocker (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blue-blocker/)

step 2: open any post that's gone viral with blusers, like [this post by Bette Midler](https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/1649218711348473856) or [this one from @TwitterBlue](https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1638988196380827651). you should see a steady stream of users getting blocked as more and more replies load in. scroll and/or repeat as necessary

step 3: enjoy your newly-enhanced Twitter browsing experience across all devices üòÅ

## faq

if there are any "verified users" you actually want to see posts from (like because they have over a million followers and [Elon Musk is horny for false endorsement](https://twitter.com/dril/status/1649919372700565504)), these extensions avoid blocking users you follow by default, so if you click "Unblock" and "Follow" on those accounts, seeing *their* posts won't be an issue
